### Dataset Variables:

#### Machine Operational Variables:

- **Type**: Indicates the quality of the product, classified into categories such as Low, Medium, or High.
- **Air Temperature [K]**: Represents the air temperature, simulated using a random process with variability around a standard value.
- **Process Temperature [K]**: Represents the temperature within the process, slightly higher than the air temperature, with its own variability.
- **Rotational Speed [rpm]**: Describes the speed at which the machine operates, calculated based on a fixed power level with added random variation.
- **Torque [Nm]**: Measures the force applied by the machine, distributed around an average value with specific variation.
- **Tool Wear [min]**: Indicates the wear on the tool, which increases based on the product quality category.
- **Machine Failure**: Indicates whether the machine has experienced a failure. Several types of failures are described.
  
- **Tool Wear Failure**: Occurs when the tool is replaced or fails after a certain amount of usage time, which is randomly determined within a specific range.
  
- **Heat Dissipation Failure**: Happens if the temperature difference between the air and process is too small, and the machine speed is below a certain threshold.
  
- **Power Failure**: Occurs when the power required for the process (calculated from torque and speed) falls outside of an acceptable range.
  
- **Overstrain Failure**: Happens when the combined effect of tool wear and torque exceeds specific limits, based on the product quality.
  
- **Random Failures**: Represents a small probability of failure occurring randomly, independent of other process parameters.

## Steps Involved For Analysis

1. **Dataset Inspection**  
   - Initially, the dataset was examined to identify its structure, data types, and any issues (e.g., missing values, duplicates).

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - **Missing Values**: Handled missing data by filling in or removing rows with missing values.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Applied standardization or normalization to numerical features to improve model performance.
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical data (like machine type or failure type) was encoded into numerical values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of individual features (e.g., using histograms and boxplots for numerical features, and bar charts for categorical features).
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., scatter plots for numerical variables, heatmaps for correlation).
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations between numerical features using correlation matrices to understand which features are strongly related.
   - **Feature Distributions**: Visualized the distribution of operational variables (e.g., Air Temperature, Torque) to check for skewness, outliers, and patterns.
   - **Failure Type Analysis**: Visualized and compared the occurrence of different failure types based on operational variables.

4. **Model Selection**  
   - **Logistic Regression**: Used as a baseline model.
   - **Decision Tree**: Selected to handle non-linear relationships and for interpretability.
   - **Random Forest**: Chosen for its robustness, ability to handle large datasets and superior performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Optimized model hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** to achieve the best performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Focused on **Recall** and **ROC AUC** as evaluation metrics. Recall was emphasized to minimize false negatives (critical for detecting machine failures).

7. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - **Random Forest** was used to identify key features influencing machine failures. This helped in understanding which operational factors are most predictive of failures.

8. **Model Deployment**  
   - The best-performing model (Random Forest with tuned hyperparameters) was saved and exported as a **Pickle** file (`best_model_rf.pkl`) for deployment.


## Key Findings and Implications

### Model Performance

- **Best Model Selection**:  
  The **Random Forest model** emerged as the best performer, achieving:
  - **Recall**: 84.04%  
  - **ROC AUC**: 95.54%
 


- **Suggestions**:  
  Random Forest is the optimal model for this predictive maintenance task due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships, its robustness against overfitting, and its high performance on the key metrics.

### Importance of Recall and ROC AUC
- **Findings**:  
  - **Recall**: A higher recall score ensures that the model catches as many failures as possible, which is crucial in the context of predictive maintenance where failing to identify a failure could lead to costly downtime.
  - **ROC AUC**: A higher ROC AUC indicates that the model performs well at distinguishing between failure and non-failure events across different thresholds.

- **Suggestions**:  
  Prioritize models with high recall to reduce the risk of missing potential failures. ROC AUC is also important for assessing overall model performance across various decision thresholds.

### Feature Engineering Insights
- **Findings**:  
  The most important features influencing failure predictions were operational variables like **Power**, **Heat Dissipation Failure (HDF)**, and **Overstrain Failure (OSF)**. These variables were critical in predicting whether a machine was likely to fail.

- **Suggestions**:  
  Focus on monitoring and improving the operational parameters related to **Power**, **HDF**, and **OSF**. These factors should be prioritized in maintenance and monitoring schedules to prevent failures.

### Model Performance Post-Tuning
- **Findings**:  
  Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV improved the performance of the Random Forest model significantly:
  - **Recall**: Increased by 5.4%
  - **ROC AUC**: Increased by 1.96%

- **Suggestions**:  
  Hyperparameter optimization is critical in improving the modelâ€™s predictive ability. Fine-tuning the model's parameters can lead to better results in real-world scenarios.


### Business Impact
- **Findings**:  
  The ability to accurately predict machine failures allows businesses to:
  - **Minimize Downtime**: Proactively schedule maintenance before machines fail.
  - **Reduce Operational Costs**: Avoid costly unscheduled repairs and downtime.
  - **Optimize Maintenance Schedules**: Use predictive insights to allocate resources efficiently and only when needed.

- **Suggestions**:  
  Deploying this model will result in improved operational efficiency, cost savings, and a more streamlined maintenance process. Businesses can utilize this tool to stay ahead of potential issues and avoid disruptions in their production schedules.
